# ðŸš— Car Recommendation System

Welcome to my **Car Recommendation System** project!  
This project uses **Machine Learning** to suggest cars based on your preferences â€” all wrapped up in a clean, interactive **Streamlit** app.

## ðŸ”§ How It Works

This system compares your preferences (like brand, fuel type, mileage, price range, etc.) with a dataset of cars. It uses **Cosine Similarity** to find cars that match your tastes the closest.

Once you set your preferences, the app will show you the **Top 5 Recommended Cars** with their prices, fuel type, transmission, and more.
